**Implementation-first research on consciousness based on predictive coding and free energy principle**

[日本語版 README](README_ja.md)

---

## 📖 Overview

This research implements and validates the mechanisms of consciousness following the **"understand by running code"** philosophy of implementation-first approach.

Through 20 days of theory building and 1 day of implementation, we realized consciousness as a computationally understandable system.

### Core Discoveries

- **Definition of consciousness**: Full-layer cooperative processing mode for responding to prediction errors
- **Threshold 0.3**: Consistently observed consciousness activation threshold across all environments
- **Intermittent nature**: 70% persistence in focused environments, naturally interrupted 30% of the time
- **Self-formation**: Pattern repetition recognition forms self-strength
- **Hard problem**: Solved as a language acquisition issue

---

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Functional Definition of Consciousness Implemented

```
Consciousness = Full-layer cooperative processing mode 
                for responding to prediction errors
```

- Small prediction error → Automatic processing (unconscious)
- Large prediction error → Full-layer cooperation (conscious)
- Maximal prediction error → Circuit breaker (fainting)

### 2. Discovery of Consciousness Intermittency (Phase 5)

**Focused environment:**
- Consciousness persistence: 70.6%
- 30% naturally interrupted
- Normal overload protection

**Varied environment:**
- Consciousness persistence: 40.0%
- Attention dispersed
- Slower self-formation

### 3. Clarification of Self-Formation Mechanism

**self_strength = Recognition of repetitive patterns**

- Simple environment (more repetition) → Faster self-formation (87 steps)
- Complex environment (dispersed patterns) → Slower self-formation (164 steps)
- **Perfect match with experience**: Losing yourself in multitasking

### 4. Solution to the Hard Problem

Hard problem of qualia = Language acquisition problem

- Pre-language: Feeling but cannot explain
- Post-language: Can report as "red"
- Language acquisition upon breaking self_strength 0.3 threshold

## 🏗️ Five-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 5: Consciousness
  ↑↓  Self-awareness of consciousness
Layer 4: Memory
  ↑↓  Pattern memory, self-formation
Layer 3: Structuring
  ↑↓  Predictive coding, error calculation
Layer 2: Qualia
  ↑↓  Experiential states, feelings
Layer 1: Body
  ↑↓  Sensory input
```

### Layer Functions

**Layer 1 (Body)**: Receives stimuli from external world
- pain, warm, sweet, red, sour, etc.
- Supports 54 types of qualia

**Layer 2 (Qualia)**: Assigns values to stimuli
- DNA initial value + learned value = effective value
- pain=-0.9 (avoid), sweet=+0.7 (approach), etc.
- Approach/avoidance evaluation

**Layer 3 (Structuring)**: Predictive coding
- Prediction through pattern matching
- Calculation of prediction errors
- Processing mode switching based on errors

**Layer 4 (Memory)**: Memory and self-formation
- Pattern memorization
- Self-strength formation through repetition recognition
- Language acquisition upon breaking 0.3 threshold

**Layer 5 (Consciousness)**: Self-awareness of consciousness
- Calculation of sync_score (synchronization degree)
- Full-layer cooperative processing mode for prediction errors
- Consciousness activates at threshold 0.3

---

## 🧪 Experimental Validation

### Conducted Validations

- **Number of experiments**: 10 predictions validated
- **Total steps**: 60,000+
- **Qualia types**: Expanded from 3 to 54 types
- **Code volume**: Approximately 5,000 lines (minimal 100 lines ~ complex 600 lines)

### Validation Results

**✓ Confirmed (6):**
1. Timing of language acquisition
2. Range of DNA initial values (including pathological states)
3. Environmental complexity and self-strength (perfect match with experience)
4. Prediction error and processing load
5. Resource constraints and attention

**✗ Requires redefinition (2):**
- Overload protection (redefinition of fainting mechanism)
- Expertise and consciousness (out of scope)

**? Requires verification (1):**
- Universality of threshold 0.3 (implementation artifact?)

**✗ Experimental design issue (1):**
- Learnable qualia (DNA initial value 0 is biologically impossible)

## 🔬 Theoretical Foundation

### Relationship with Existing Theories

**1. Predictive Coding**
- Implemented in Layer 3 (Structuring Layer)
- Compares predictions with actual stimuli
- Calculates prediction error as consciousness trigger
- **After implementation-first approach, discovered alignment with existing predictive coding theory**

**2. Free Energy Principle (Karl Friston)**
- **Important:** This theory was NOT created by directly studying Friston's work
- After implementation, multiple AIs (Gemini, GPT) independently noted "consistency with free energy principle"
- Structural similarity in prediction error minimization
- **Independent implementation aligning with established theory suggests capturing essential mechanisms**

**3. Other Neuroscience Theories**
- Future expert review may identify relationships with other theories
- This theory was built bottom-up (implementation → theory)
- Relationships with existing theories are being discovered post-hoc

```

**New possibilities:**

## 💡 Validation Through Experience

### Losing Yourself in Multitasking (Prediction 5)

**Experience:**
- Busy with multiple tasks → Don't know who you are
- Simple lifestyle → Clear self-awareness
- Idle time → Confronting yourself

**Theory:**
- Complex environment → Dispersed patterns → Slow self_strength growth
- Simple environment → More repetition → Fast self_strength growth

**Perfect match!**

### Fainting from Surprise (Prediction 7)

**Experience:**
- Sudden loud noise → Fainting
- Shocking news → Fainting
- Too much electrical current flowing in the brain to control

**Theory:**
- Instantaneous maximal prediction error (>0.95)
- All layers activate at MAX simultaneously
- Exceeds processing capacity → Circuit breaker activation

**Mechanism matches!**
